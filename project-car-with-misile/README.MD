# Computer Graphics – Car With Missile Project

## Overview
This project is developed for the **Computer Graphics** course.  
It consists of a simple car with a missile mounted on top. When the car collides with a wall, the collision is detected and resolved correctly.

## Objectives
- Learn and apply **OpenGL** basics.
- Use **transformations** (translation, rotation, scaling).
- Implement a **car and missile system** with hierarchical transformations.
- Handle **collision detection and response** with walls.
- Add **basic interactivity** (keyboard/mouse).
- Explore **lighting and shading models** for visualization.

## Controls (planned)
- **W / S** → Move car forward / backward  
- **A / D** → Rotate car  
- **Space** → Launch missile  
- **R** → Reset scene  

## Deliverables
- **40%**: PDF (design, user manual, installation manual)  
- **40%**: Source code in GitHub  
- **10%**: Demonstration video  
- **10%**: Final presentation
